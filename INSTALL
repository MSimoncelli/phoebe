The installation requires:
* cmake
* gcc, version compatible with c++17
* internet connection (we will download external libraries)

To install Phoebe, type:
git submodule update --init
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

This will create two executables:
* phoebe
* runTests (for developers)

In order to compile the documentation, you need to have installed:
* doxygen
* graphviz
Then type
* make doc

Tested with gcc v9. Note that old compilers may not support c++17.
