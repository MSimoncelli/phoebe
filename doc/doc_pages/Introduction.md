@mainpage Introduction

Phoebe is a software for the characterization of transport properties from ab-initio, such as electron-phonon limited conductivity and phonon thermal conductivity. This C++ code supports GPU acceleration for modern HPC infrastructures.

Currently, we fully support integration with the ab-initio software suite Quantum ESPRESSO. More supported codes will be coming soon.

This guide contains tutorials to guide you through the calculation of properties, an input file description, and a theory handbook. The Developer's documentation section contains a brief overview of the code structure, and is complemented with a detailed description of purpose and methods for each class.

This documentation contains a brief description of the formalism used to compute these quantities. We expect however that the user is already familiar with ab-initio codes and with the fundamentals of solid state physics. A good introduction to the topic is the book "Electrons and Phonons: The Ttheory of Transport Phenomena in Solids". In the theory section, we add references to contemporary literature for the latest method/algorithms developments.
