@mainpage Overview

Phoebe is a software for the characterization of transport properties from ab-initio, such as electron-phonon limited conductivity and phonon thermal conductivity. This C++ code supports GPU acceleration for modern HPC infrastructures.

Currently, we support the following ab-initio codes:
* Quantum ESPRESSO
* ...

This guide contains a tutorial to showcase the usage of the code, and a theory handbook. The Developer's documentation section contains a brief overview of the code structure, and is complemented with a detailed description of purpose and methods for each class.

This documentation contains a brief description of the formalism used to compute these quantities. We expect however that the user is already familiar with ab-initio codes and with the fundamentals of solid state physics. A good introduction to the topic is the book "Electrons and Phonons: The Ttheory of Transport Phenomena in Solids". In the theory section, we add references to contemporary literature for the latest method/algorithms developments.
